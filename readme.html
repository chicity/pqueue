<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>Priority queue with array based heap.</p>

<p>A priority queue is like a standard queue, except that each inserted
elements is given a certain priority, based on the result of the comparison
block given at instantiation time. Also, retrieving an element from the
queue will always return the one with the highest priority (see #pop and
#top).</p>

<p>The default is to compare the elements in repect to their #&lt;=&gt;
method. For example, Numeric elements with higher values will have higher
priorities.</p>

<p>This library is  a rewrite of the original PQueue.rb by K. Kodama and
Heap.rb by Ronald Butler. The two libraries were later merged and generally
improved by Olivier Renaud. Then the whole library  rewritten by Trans
using the orginal as a functional reference.</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>

<pre>require 'pqueue'

pq = PQueue.new([2,3,1]){ |a,b| a &gt; b }

pq.pop  #=&gt; 3</pre>
