== DESCRIPTION

Priority queue with array based heap.

A priority queue is like a standard queue, except that each inserted
elements is given a certain priority, based on the result of the
comparison block given at instantiation time. Also, retrieving an element
from the queue will always return the one with the highest priority
(see #pop and #top).

The default is to compare the elements in repect to their #> method.
For example, Numeric elements with higher values will have higher
priorities.

This library is based off the original PQueue.rb by K.Kodama and
Heap.rb by Ronald Butler. The two libraries were later merged
and generally improved by Olivier Renaud.
