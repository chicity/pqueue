summary: Queue of Prioritized Elements
title: PQueue
version: 2.0.2
name: pqueue
description: ! 'A priority queue is like a standard queue, except that each inserted
  elements

  is given a certain priority, based on the result of the comparison block given

  at instantiation time. Retrieving an element from the queue will always return

  the one with the highest priority.'
